# Balancing Policy Objectives in Social Security Reform

Authors: Arvind Sharma, Aleksandar Tomic, and Lawrence Fulton
Affiliation: Department of Applied Analytics and Economics, Boston College

A stochastic, multi-criteria decision framework (Hierarchical Weighted Multi-voting + Mixed-Integer Goal Programming) to evaluate 142 Social Security reform proposals across six policy dimensions: ICB, T, E, S, AF, PV. The optimization enforces a 3.5% actuarial balance constraint and explores uncertainty via Dirichlet-sampled weights.
