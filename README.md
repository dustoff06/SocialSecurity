# Balancing Policy Objectives in Social Security Reform

Authors: Arvind Sharma, Aleksandar Tomic, and Lawrence Fulton
Affiliation: Department of Applied Analytics and Economics, Boston College

A stochastic, multi-criteria decision framework (Hierarchical Weighted Multi-voting + Mixed-Integer Goal Programming) to evaluate 142 Social Security reform proposals across six policy dimensions: ICB, T, E, S, AF, PV. The optimization enforces a 3.5% actuarial balance constraint and explores uncertainty via Dirichlet-sampled weights.

## 1. LaTeX toolchain (paper)

The paper uses apa7 + biblatex with biber.

Build sequence (local):
```bash
cd paper
pdflatex paper.tex
biber paper
pdflatex paper.tex
pdflatex paper.tex
```

* Required packages (already used in the preamble):
apa7, babel, csquotes, biblatex with \DeclareLanguageMapping{american}{american-apa}, booktabs, amsmath, amssymb, graphicx, threeparttable, siunitx.

## 2.  R environment (analysis)

This repo uses a single R Markdown file:

updated SS 4_23.Rmd renders to PDF and writes any LaTeX-ready tables/figures into paper/tables/ and paper/figures/.

Suggested R packages:
```bash
install.packages(c(
  "corrplot", "eia", "EnvStats", "fitdistrplus", "fpp3", "fredr", "ggpattern",
  "ggrepel", "gridExtra", "gtools", "kableExtra", "knitr", "latex2exp", "lpSolveAPI",
  "MASS", "magrittr", "MCMCpack", "metR", "psych", "readxl", "ResourceSelection",
  "tidyverse", "viridis", "data.table", "jsonlite", "here", "rmarkdown"
))
```

## Data

Location: data/raw/ (raw inputs only).

No processed data are committed; all derivatives are produced at render time by Rmd.

## Reproducibility

This analysis is designed to be fully reproducible and deterministic. All key settings and parameters are documented within the main RMD file.

### Determinism

To ensure reproducibility across runs:

- A fixed random seed is set at the start of the analysis:
  
  ```r
  set.seed(42)
.

### Key Knobs (documented in the Rmd)

- **Dirichlet Parameters**  
  - \( \alpha \): construct-level weights  
  - \( \beta \): within-construct model weights

- **Penalty Parameter**  
  - \( \lambda \sim \text{Uniform}(0.2, 0.7) \)

- **Portfolio Size**  
  - \( N_{\text{max}} \in \{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 \} \)

- **Actuarial Baselines**  
  - Trustees’ actuarial assumptions year (fixed for the analysis)

## How the Pieces Fit

### .RMD

- Loads raw inputs from `data/raw/`  
- Cleans and validates COAs and scores  
- Samples Dirichlet weights (construct + model)  
- Solves MILPs using `lpSolveAPI`, enforcing a 3.5% balance constraint  
- Runs sensitivity analyses (Jaccard similarity, Cohen’s κ, scenario perturbations)  
- Exports tables and figures to `paper/tables/` and `paper/figures/`  
- Renders an optional PDF supplement report

### `paper/paper.tex`

- Includes exported tables and figures  
- Contains **Appendix A/B/C** as separate TeX files in `paper/appendices/`  
- Builds the final manuscript PDF with references drawn from `references.bib`

## Appendices (included in the paper)

### Appendix A – Complete Optimization Model Specification
Full MILP and goal programming formulation, including decision variables, constraints, linearizations, and solver settings.

### Appendix B – Simulation Algorithm
End-to-end algorithm description: Dirichlet sampling, objective construction, constraint enforcement, optimization loop, convergence checks, and export steps.

### Appendix C – Inter-Rater Reliability Statistics
Spearman rank correlations and weighted Cohen’s \( \kappa \) across models and constructs, including interpretation thresholds and confidence intervals.

These appendices are part of the LaTeX paper (`paper/appendices/*.tex`) and are also described in the R Markdown file where the computations are performed.

Data: Per source terms; include provenance and any redistribution limits in data/raw/README.md.

## Common Pitfalls

References don’t appear: run biber (not BibTeX) between LaTeX passes.

Float ended by wrong environment: ensure \begin{table} matches \end{table} (avoid table* unless two-column).

Undefined citation: key not present in references.bib; add it or fix the key.

R Markdown can’t find data: verify files in data/raw/ and paths used in analysis.Rmd.
